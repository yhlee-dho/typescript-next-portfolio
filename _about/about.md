# My name is Yong Lee
I am a full stack web developer with a background in marketing and publishing.
In order to make the transition from my previous background to the coding world I co-founded a web development company named Windy City Devs.
Although I do constantly learn various ways to develop websites, I received my training at Northwestern University through the school of professional studiesâ€™ full stack web development program.
Prior to that I was involved in a variety of different opportunities. I owned an internet cafe business, I worked for a local politician, and a local newspaper publisher.
By utilizing all of my past experiences, I am excited to work together with my team to produce results.
