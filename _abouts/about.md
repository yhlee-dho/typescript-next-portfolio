# My name is Yong Lee

I am a full stack web developer at Windy City Devs.

On July of 2020 I co-founded Windy City Devs with Joe Shields and Andrew Ross.
Our goal was to immerse ourselves into the web development industry so that we may improve our coding skills and we strive to go over and beyond each day.

At Windy City Devs, we utilize Typescript for its superior error handling capabilities, and Next.js as our framework of choice for its compatability with Typescript and its amazingly simple Vercel integration for deployment.
						
Our styling of choice is Tailwinds.css for its ease of utilizing class names and viewport.
For our databases we favor MongoDB because of its accessibility to other coding languages.
Lastly, for our servers we utilize AWS Lightsail.							
Althought it does lack some answers in stack overflow, its test environment allows for quick testing and eventually there is no better space than the AWS cloud to store client apps.

I received my initial training at Northwestern University through the school of professional studiesâ€™ full stack web development program.

Prior to my assimilation to code, my background was in marketing and publishing.
Korea Times is an ethnic local newspaper company that serves 23 midwest states as a daily newspaper publisher.
At Korea Times I managed daily operations and edited the U.S. sections.
